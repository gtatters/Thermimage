Description: A collection of functions and routines for inputting thermal
    image video files, plotting and converting binary raw data into estimates of
    temperature.  First published 2015-03-26.  Written primarily for research purposes
    in biological applications of thermal images.  v1 included the base calculations 
    for converting thermal image binary values to temperatures. v2 included additional
    equations for providing heat transfer calculations and an import function for thermal
    image files (v2.2.3 fixed error importing thermal image to windows OS). v3. Added numerous
    functions for importing thermal image videos, rewriting and exporting.
